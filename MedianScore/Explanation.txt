The solution used for  the assignment consists of a simple insertion sort.  The algorithm has a worst case complexity of O(n^2)  and a  best case complexity of  O(n).  I am using this approach because it is a simple, easy to implement stable algorithm. On each step one element gets sorted in the left. This helps us  find  the medians with O(1) complexity  in every range(0-i) after each inner cycle . The algorithm can probably be optimized by using an optimized version of insertion sort.
